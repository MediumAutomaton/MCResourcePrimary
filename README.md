# MCResourcePrimary
My primary Minecraft Bedrock resource pack. Use with "MCBehaviorPrimary" for full functionality. This just provides a bunch of extra things that I use in the game.
See the Wiki for information on everything this pack changes.
Added blocks require the Behavior Pack, so they and other things requiring the Behavior Pack will be listed in its wiki.
